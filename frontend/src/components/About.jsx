        <p>
          Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Avantika, a Computer Science graduate, who genuinely
          takes delight with building things that work and look good. Whether
          it's architecting a full-stack inventory system or fine-tuning AI
          models to actually do what they're supposed to, I'm all about creating
          software that solves real problems not just checking boxes. My journey
          started with a curious kid tinkering with code, and now I'm here,
          experimenting in React components, wrestling with databases, and
          occasionally convincing AI tools to be my coding buddies (shoutout to
          GitHub Copilot for the late-night saves). I've spent my internships
          working across various tech domains during my college; from optimizing
          ERP systems and crunching SQL data to testing AI models and automating
          code quality checks at Genisys Group. Turns out, I really enjoy the
          challenge of making systems smarter, faster, and more reliable. Beyond
          the code, I've led communities, organized massive cultural fests, and
          somehow managed to co-author a couple of research papers on sentiment
          analysis and AI in cybersecurity (because why not, right?). I thrive
          in environments where collaboration meets creativity, and I'm always
          game for learning something new whether that's a framework I've never
          touched or a problem I've never solved. 
          </p>
          <p>
          <b>What I'm looking for:</b> Software
          and web development roles where I can contribute from day one, grow
          with a team that values innovation, and work on projects that actually
          matter. If you're building something exciting and need someone who
          brings both technical chops and genuine enthusiasm, let's talk! Scroll
          down to explore my journey- my initial dive into tech, the skills I've
          builtÂ alongÂ theÂ way
